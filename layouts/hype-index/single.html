    <h2>How we rate</h2>
    <p><strong>Verified</strong> — the claim was demonstrably accurate and supported by independent evidence at time of publication.</p>
    <p><strong>Supported</strong> — the claim is directionally accurate but stronger than the evidence strictly warrants.</p>
    <p><strong>Plausible</strong> — the claim is reasonable but not yet testable; time will tell.</p>
    <p><strong>Overstated</strong> — the claim exceeded what the evidence supported in a meaningful way.</p>
    <p><strong>False</strong> — the claim was demonstrably wrong at time of publication.</p>
    <p><strong>Source reliability</strong> ratings are relative to each source's own track record, not an absolute standard. "Uncharacteristic" means a source that usually does better missed here. "Consistent pattern" means the overstating is the track record.</p>
