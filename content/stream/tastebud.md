About a decade ago, I had an idea I couldn't build yet.

What if flavor had a visual representation? Not a chart or a wheel — an interactive space where shapes represent sweet, salty, umami, spicy, sour, and bitter. You place an ingredient and watch its flavor profile respond in real time: shapes resize, distort, change color. Swap ingredients in and out of a recipe and *see* whether the balance works before you ever turn on the stove.

The basic layer teaches the grammar of taste. What happens when you add acid to richness. Why a pinch of salt makes chocolate taste more like chocolate. How brightness emerges from combinations of characteristics you'd never think to pair.

Then there's a layer above that: AI mentors modeled on great food thinkers. Not chatbots wearing their names — genuine teaching paths where Bourdain's sensibility or Pépin's technique guides you from simple flavor understanding to creative improvisation. Culinary education that adapts to how you actually learn.

I called it TasteBud. The name works on every level I need it to.

The technology to build this didn't exist when I first imagined it. Visualization tools were expensive, AI was crude, real-time interaction at this fidelity was a fantasy. Now it's all available. The constraint was never the idea — it was the infrastructure.

This is the kind of software I care about building. Tools that amplify how humans already think about complex domains rather than replacing that thinking with something flatter and more machine-convenient. The same philosophy that drives everything else in this stream.
