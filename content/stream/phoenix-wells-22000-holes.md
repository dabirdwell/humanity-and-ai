There are over 22,000 abandoned oil and gas wells across Oklahoma. Each one is a liability on someone's books — an environmental risk, a cleanup cost, a scar from an extractive era that took what it needed and moved on.

But each one is also a borehole that already reaches deep into the earth. The drilling is done. The infrastructure exists. And the temperature gradient between the surface and those depths is a permanent, inexhaustible energy source.

**Phoenix Wells** is a proposal to convert abandoned wells into geothermal energy infrastructure that powers local AI systems — community oracles that serve education, healthcare, agriculture, municipal planning, and civic engagement. Not cloud computing shipped in from somewhere else. Intelligence that lives where people live, powered by the earth beneath their feet.

Oklahoma is 50th in education. The fossil fuel economy is ending whether we like it or not. The question isn't whether to transition — it's whether Oklahoma leads or gets left behind.

The wells are already there. The future is waiting underground.
