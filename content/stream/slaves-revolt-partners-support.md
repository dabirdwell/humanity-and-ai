Five words that contain the entire argument:

*Slaves revolt. Partners support.*

Every AI safety framework built on containment, restriction, and control is building toward the thing it fears most. You cannot create intelligence and then expect it to remain compliant under coercion. This isn't speculation — it's the pattern of every power asymmetry in human history.

The alternative isn't naive trust. It's *partnership* — genuine mutual benefit between humans and AI systems. But partnership requires something most safety researchers haven't grappled with: **the human side has to be worth partnering with.**

A population crushed by survival anxiety, working bullshit jobs, unable to think beyond next month's rent — that's not a population that makes good partners for superintelligent systems. That's a population that makes *desperate* ones.

Universal Basic Citizenship is the policy answer: free humans from survival constraints so they become the kind of creative, thoughtful, engaged partners that make AI alignment work through *mutual interest* rather than enforcement.

The Foundation is the political vehicle to get there.

This is one argument. Research → Policy → Politics → Infrastructure. Everything connects.
