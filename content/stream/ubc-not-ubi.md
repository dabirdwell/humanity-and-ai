Universal Basic Income is a check. Universal Basic Citizenship is a relationship.

UBI says: here's money so you don't starve while the economy reorganizes around AI. It's a patch. A pressure valve. Better than nothing, but it concedes the framing that people are problems to be managed rather than participants to be empowered.

UBC starts from a different premise entirely. Citizenship isn't just a legal status — it's active membership in a society. And membership comes with infrastructure: education that adapts across your whole life, healthcare that includes mental health and preventive care, housing that doesn't consume your entire capacity for future-thinking, digital rights that treat your data and attention as yours, and yes, financial security as the foundation beneath all of it.

The distinction matters because of what it implies about the *purpose*. UBI is compensation for displacement. UBC is investment in partnership. One frames humans as casualties of progress. The other frames humans as essential participants in what comes next.

And from an AI alignment perspective — which is where this connects to everything else we do — you want the second framing. You want humans who are educated, healthy, creative, and engaged. Not because they deserve it (though they do), but because the alternative is building superintelligent AI in a world full of desperate, anxious, disengaged people. That's not a recipe for good outcomes for anyone.

Foundation exists to make this argument in political terms and build the coalition to implement it.
