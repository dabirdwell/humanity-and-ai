My friend Amanda is a master quilter. Talking to her about her work, I realized that quilting software was built by software people, not quilt people. The tools force quilters to think in grids and coordinates when they're actually thinking in relationships — how this fabric plays against that one, how a color shifts meaning when its neighbor changes.

**Quiltographer** is a pattern design tool that starts from how quilters actually think. It understands fabric as material with drape and grain. It knows that a quarter-inch seam allowance isn't optional. It treats color the way quilters treat color — not as hex codes but as relationships that shift under different lighting.

This is one of the software projects under Humanity and AI — not because quilting is an AI problem, but because building tools that respect how humans actually think is the entire thesis. Technology should amplify human intelligence, not flatten it into something machines find convenient.

If you're a quilter or know one, the project is in active development.
